    //MARK: -------- CUSTOM METHODS --------
    ///this method gets called when the long press gesture recognizer registers a long press; this function places a temporary annotation view as soon as the long press begins, but immediately moves to the .changed state in which the location gets updated with the finger scroll and allows the pin to move with the finger; in .Ended, a new PinAnnotation is created using the final location of the temporary annoation, the temporary annotation is removed from the map and the new PinAnnoation is added to the map (this was necessary because tapping on a pin that was associated with an MKPointAnnoation and NOT a PinAnnotation creates problems because that pin's annoation property would not point to the desired PinAnnotation, as needed for the didSelectAnnotationView and prepareForSegue to be passed into the next view controller; i originally had this set up so that a PinAnnotation object was set up in the .Began and the latitutde/longitude of that object was updated throughout the drag (see earlier commits for what this looked like), which i thought would work because after all PinAnnotation was designed to be MKAnnotation-conforming (and i set the draggable property to true on viewForAnnoation); however, for some reason that i couldn't quite figure out, the pin would not move along with the drag when associated with a PinAnnotation, and i suspect it had something to with how the PinAnnotation made known its updated location to the mapView.  an MKPointAnnotation, on the other hand, DOES exhibit this able-to-be-dragged effect by default without any issue at all, and so that is why i used that class as the class for the temporary annotation.  this is something i still want to research because i believe there is a cleaner way to do this that enables a PinAnnotion to undergo the same dragging effect as an MKPointAnnotation (it think it may have something to do with getters, setters, the setCoordinate method on the MKAnnotation protocol, and/or the draggable property on the MKAnnotationView); but alas, i feel that the solution i came up with is good enough! (since there is no noticable difference)
