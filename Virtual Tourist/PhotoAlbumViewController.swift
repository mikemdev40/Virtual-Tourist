    //MARK: -------- PROPERTIES --------
    //computed property that returns the delta latitude for the MKCoordinateSpan of the mini-map located above the photo album; the longitude is a constant and the latitude is computed based on that constant as well as the ratio of the mapview's frame's height to width (thus allowing the region to show a zomm level that is constant for any size device)
    var SpanDeltaLatitude: CLLocationDegrees {
        let mapViewRatio = mapView.frame.height / mapView.frame.width

    //properties that are set by the segued-from MapViewController; the annotationToShow holds a reference to the PinAnnotation that was selected on the map, and the isStillLoadingText is either set in the prepareForSegue method, or it not, just initialized as nil (the property observer updates the UILabel's text and unhides it if its string gets updated in response to "no images found" -- the optional unwrapping on the noPhotosLabel is required in order to prevent the initial crash that would otherwise occur when the string is set in the prepareForSegue, which leads to an attempt to update the properties of an implicitly unwrapped "noPhotosLabel" outlet that hasn't been set yet and is still nil!)

    //through testing with the NSManagedObjectContext notifcations, it seems that the invocation of the controllerDidChangeContent method on the fetch controller's delegate is related to the NSManagedObjectContextObjectsDidChangeNotification being posted by the context, which occurs after all deletions are finished (either as part of the removeImages or getNewCollection methods) AND after any new images are retrieved and saved (as part of the getNewCollection method); the deletions that occur within getNewCollection invoke this method once after all are completed - despite there being no explicit save of the context in between the photos being deleted and the new images being retrieved; within the removeImages, this method is SEEMS to invoked BEFORE the save actually occurs, although it is hard to know for sure; interestingly, if the context.save() method is performend after EACH individual deletion, i.e. within the iteration loop, then this delegate method gets invoked in EACH iteration through the loop; similary for the new images, this method gets invoked ONCE after ALL images have been added (but seemingly before the actual save happens, although again it's hard to tell), but if the save() occurs within the save iteration loop (which occurs within the CoreDataStack.savePhotosToPin method), then this method is being invoked with each interation of the loop.  despite it being still unclear EXACTLY what causes the invocation of this method, one thing is clear:  we want to ensure that this method ONLY gets invoked at the right time (thus enabling the efficient batch update), and to ensure this happens, we should only save the context ONCE after ALL deletions and/or insertions to the context have been made (i.e. don't save the context after EACH deletion or insertion) - which makes sense anyways!!!
